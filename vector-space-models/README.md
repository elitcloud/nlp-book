# Vector Space Models

A **vector space model** \(VSM\) represents input text into a vector space so that the input can be processed by machine learning algorithms.  Traditional NLP approaches adapted VSMs generating [sparse vectors](sparse-vectors/).  However, modern NLP approaches adapt VSMs generating [dense vectors](dense-vectors/) that are more suitable for deep learning-based models using neural networks.
