# Document Classification

This chapter explains how to develop NLP components for a document classification task known as [sentiment analysis](sentiment-analysis.md).  Given a document, the goal of **document classification** is to label the document with a certain class \(e.g., positive or negative\) by inferring contextual information of the document.  Note that approaches described in the following sections are not restricted to only sentiment analysis but can be generalized to any document classification task.
