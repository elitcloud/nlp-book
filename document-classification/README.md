# Document Classification

This chapter explains how to develop NLP components for a document classification task known as [sentiment analysis](sentiment-analysis.md).  Given an input document, the goal is to classify it into a certain sentiment \(e.g., positive or negative\) by inferring contextual information from the document.  Note that models described here are not restricted to sentiment analysis but can be generalized to any document classification task.
