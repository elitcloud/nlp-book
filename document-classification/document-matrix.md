# Document Matrix

A document can be represented as a matrix $$D \in \mathcal{R}^{n \times d}$$ where $$n$$ is the number of words and $$d$$ is the dimension of word embeddings such that the $$i$$'th row in $$D$$ represents the $$i$$'th word in the document:

Word embeddings can be retrieved by a [vector space model]().  A document can be a sentence, a tweet, a movie review, or an article in Wikipedia.
