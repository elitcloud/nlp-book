# Vector Space Model

A **vector space model** represents input text into a vector space, which allows NLP components to extract feature vectors for machine learning algorithms.  This chapter describes three vector space models, Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe, that are commonly used to represent words as vectors in NLP.
