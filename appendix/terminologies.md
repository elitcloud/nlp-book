# Terminologies

* **Token**: a basic linguistic unit that has a full semantic of its own.  Typical words \(e.g., girl, pretty\), abbreviations \(e.g., Mr., 's\), as well as symbols \(e.g., $, :-\)\) are all considered individual tokens.  See [Tokenization](../nlp-tasks/tokenization.md) for more details.
* **Sentence**: a list of tokens.
* **Document**: a list of sentences.
